        Iâ€™m a full stack software engineer with a knack for crafting clean,
        tested, and modular code. With a keen eye on the end goal, whether in a
        mob, pairs, or solo, I take pride in executing the task, solving
        problems along the way, and overall going above and beyond. Guiding the
        user experience through well written code and a thoughtfully built site
        is always the objective. I own a very cute dog who has been known to
        make appearances on Zoom calls.
